## This is a template .gitignore file which is originally copied from here:
## https://github.com/joundso/Snippets/blob/master/.gitignore

## At first: Ignore everything:
/*
/*/

## Then successively add the whitlist elements you want to track:
!/.gitignore
!/*.md

## ---
## FOLDERS
## ---
## If we want to track a folder, whitelist it completely:
!/R/
!/misc/

## ... but then immedeately blacklist all its content:
/R/*
/misc/*

## ... and then whitelist files we want to track explicitly:
!/R/treemap.R
!/misc/toilet_warning.md

## Add folders completely (there might be another .gitignore file inside):
!/FHIR/
!/gitlab/

## Ignore all log-related files:
**/*[Ll]og*
**/*.log
